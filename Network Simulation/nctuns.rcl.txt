1.	 Click on “access point”. Goto wireless interface and tick on “show transmission range and then click OK.
2.	Double click on Router -> Node Editor and then
Left stack -> throughput of Incoming packets
Right stack -> throughput of Outgoing packets
3.	Select mobile hosts and access points then click on.
Tools -> WLAN mobile nodes-> WLAN Generate infrastructure.
Subnet ID: Port number of router (2)
Gateway ID: IP address of router
4.	Mobile Host 1
ttcp –t –u –s –p 3000 1.0.1.1
5.	Mobile Host 1
ttcp –t –u –s –p 3001 1.0.1.1
6.	Host(Receiver)
ttcp –r –u –s –p 3000
ttcp –r –u –s –p 3001
7.	Run and then play to plot the graph.
